Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []
        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and t > stack[-1][0]:
                stackT, stackInd = stack.pop()
                res[stackInd] = (i - stackInd)
            stack.append([t,i])

        return res
